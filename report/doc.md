# EAU2 Project

By: Snowy Chen and Joe Song

## Introduction

where we give a high-level description of the eau2 system.

## Architecture

where we describe the various part of eau2 at a high-level.

## Implementation

where we describe how the system is built, this can include
 a description of the classes and their API, but only the class you deem relevant and worth describing. (For example: do not describe the utility classes.)

## Use cases

examples of uses of the system. This could be in the form of code
 like the one above. It is okay to leave this section mostly empty if there is nothing to say. Maybe just an example of creating a dataframe would be enough.

## Open questions

where you list things that you are not sure of and would
 like the answer to.

## Status

where you describe what has been done and give an estimate of the work
 that remains.
